# AutoReplant
 A Bukkit plugin that automatically replants certain crops when the player right-clicks them with a hoe, at the cost of damaging the hoe. Enchantments are ignored when auto-replanting. (Fortune might work, I'm not sure.)
 
 Currently supported crops are Wheat, Beetroot, Potatoes, Carrots, Sugarcane and Nether Wart.
 
 **This plugin was made for Bukkit-based servers on Minecraft v1.16.\*,** but may work on older/newer versions too. Best case, you'll just get a little error saying that it's running on an unsupported version of Minecraft, but it should work fine. I haven't tested it, so good luck if you need it.
 
 Servers running CraftBukkit, Spigot, Paper, etc. should also be compatible, since they are basically just extensions of Bukkit.
 
 ## How to install
 
 Like any other Bukkit plugin, download a copy of the AutoReplant.jar file and place it inside your server's plugins/ directory.
 
 ## Older versions
 
 There are other Bukkit plugins named AutoReplant in various places for earlier versions of Minecraft. I didn't make those, and I won't support any versions older than 1.16. I just picked the same name because it's an obvious thing to search for when people want this functionality.
