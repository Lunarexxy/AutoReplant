# AutoReplant
 A Bukkit plugin that automatically replants certain crops when the player right-clicks them with a hoe, at the cost of damaging the hoe. Enchantments are ignored when auto-replanting. (Fortune might work, I'm not sure.)
 
 Currently supported crops are Wheat, Beetroot, Potatoes, Carrots, Sugarcane and Nether Wart. Pumpkins are dropped as Carved Pumpkins when sheared.
 
 Built for Minecraft **1.16.\***. Some other versions may work too, but I haven't tested them.
 
 *(Servers running CraftBukkit, Spigot, Paper, etc. should also be compatible, since they are basically just extensions of Bukkit.)*
 
 ## How to install
 
 Like any other Bukkit plugin, download a copy of the AutoReplant.jar file and place it inside your server's plugins/ directory.
 
 ## Older versions
 
 There are other Bukkit plugins named AutoReplant in various places for earlier versions of Minecraft. I didn't make those, and I won't support any versions older than 1.16. I just picked the same name because it's an obvious thing to search for when people want this functionality.
